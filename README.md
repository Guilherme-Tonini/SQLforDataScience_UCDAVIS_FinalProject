# Final Project for "SQL Basics for Data Science" Course
This repository contains the final project for the "SQL Basics for Data Science" course offered by UC Davis. The project aims to apply a wide range of SQL concepts and design techniques discussed throughout the course. In this assignment, you will take on the role of a real-world data scientist, using SQL to answer specific questions for an organization and draw inferences based on your discoveries.

## Course Project Description
This assignment is designed to test your knowledge of various SQL concepts and design techniques covered in the course. You will work with a dataset from Yelp, a US-based organization that offers a platform for users to provide reviews and ratings for a variety of organizations, including businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, and charitable organizations. This project provides an opportunity to analyze and draw insights from real-world data.

## Assignment Details
This project consists of two parts:

### Part 1: Profiling and Understanding Data
In the first part of the assignment, you will be asked a series of questions about the Yelp dataset to help you profile and better understand the data, just like a data scientist would. Your answers to these questions will involve writing various SQL statements. You will be assessed based on the correctness of your findings as well as the clarity and readability of your code.

### Part 2: Inferences and Analysis
The second part of the assignment involves coming up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a specific question. You will be required to prepare a dataset for your chosen analysis. Similar to the first part, your code's readability and clarity will be evaluated.
