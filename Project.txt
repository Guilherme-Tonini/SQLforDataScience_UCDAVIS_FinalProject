2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
      The DB has data on 10000 businesses out of which 8480 are open and the remaining 1520 are closed. 
         
ii. Difference 2:
There majority of the businesses that are open have between 4.0 and 5.0 stars (4355 businesses). There are only 3756 businesses open that have between 2.0 to 3.0 stars.   
+---------+-------+--------------+
| is_open | stars | n_businesses |
+---------+-------+--------------+
|       1 |   2.0 |          472 |

|       1 |   5.0 |         1427 |
+---------+-------+--------------+

         
SQL code used for analysis:
Difference 1: 

  	-- count open businesses
  	SELECT COUNT(is_open)
  	FROM business
  	Where is_open=1
	 -- count closed businesses
   	SELECT COUNT(is_open)
  	FROM business
  	WHERE is_open=0

Difference 2

	SELECT 
		is_open
  		,stars
  		,COUNT(id) AS n_businesses
  	FROM business
  	GROUP BY is_open,stars
  	HAVING is_open=1 ANS stars between 2.0 ANS 5.0 -- if is_open=1, then the business is actually open.
  
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
      Determine if there is a correlation between category and star rating within a city
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
      I joined data from the business table with the categories table to see if the a business category has a impact on stars (or viceversa) in the city of Mesa . I also pulled review_count and is_open as this factor may affect the analysis       

iii. Output of your finished dataset:
+------+-----------------------------+-------+--------------+---------+
